# The 9thWonder Denver Restroom Monitor

We have four restrooms. Nobody can see any of the restrooms from their desk, so finding an available toilet requires trekking up and down hallways.

This app makes it more efficient by showing users available restrooms, along with their preferred restroom status (presumably the closest).

I wrote this to learn. It's my first Electron app. If you just said Electron uses too much memory, then I'm happy to accept your native version written in C or assembly. I was not about to write a useless app twice for both Windows and Mac.

I also wanted to use web sockets via Lambda, as well as play with machine learning to predict restroom open/close times and occupied lengths. Unnecessary, yes, but fascinating to learn.

## To Use

Just change config-example.js to config.js and set the proper API endpoints. Then, somebody will have to post the code to all the Lambda functions. I may do that someday.

But let's be real here. This was a learning project for me, and it is useless to virtually everyone, including those for whom it was written. Nobody will be reading this or attempting to revise the app.
